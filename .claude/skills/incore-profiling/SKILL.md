# In-Core Kernel Profiling (msprof op-simulator)

Run cycle-accurate, single-AI-core profiling of every PTOAS kernel in a PyPTO
build via the Ascend `msprof op simulator`. For each kernel the tool generates a
standalone testcase, builds it, runs it on the op-simulator, and collects the
Insight trace artifacts.

This is **runtime** profiling — distinct from the compiler's
`report/perf_hints.log`, which records compile-time hints. Use that file for
"why is codegen suggesting X"; use this skill for "how does the kernel actually
execute".

## When to use

- The user wants per-kernel timing / instruction-level traces of a built case.
- The user asks for MindStudio Insight traces or `trace.json` artifacts.
- The user wants to compare kernel execution cost across changes.

## Prerequisites

- A built case containing sibling `.pto` and `.cpp` files in a top-level or
  nested `ptoas/` directory.
- A TL-capable CANN installation and readable `set_env.sh`; pass
  `--cann-set-env` when auto-discovery selects the wrong installation.
- The `msprof op simulator` worker (`msopprof`). The tool can copy a compatible
  local worker when it is missing; use `--msopprof` to select one explicitly.
- `ptoas-bin` installed. Use `--ptoas-root` only when the full validation
  harness is required.

Per-kernel build and collect directories are private (mode `0700`).

## Quick start

```bash
python .claude/skills/incore-profiling/incore_profile.py \
  --build-dir build_output/<case> --target a2a3
```

- `--target a2a3` for Ascend A2/A3 devices, `--target a5` for A5. This sets the
  compile arch (`dav-c220` / `dav-c310`) and constrains camodel-SoC selection.
- `--case <model.py>` instead of `--build-dir` builds the case first, then
  profiles it. Arguments after `--` are forwarded to the case script.
- `--list-funcs --build-dir <dir>` previews the kernels without running anything
  (needs no toolchain).
- `--func <name>` profiles a single kernel; repeatable.

## Standalone real-device comparison

Compare exact compact and loose PTOAS sources. For large models, prefer
deterministic standalone ABI inputs: full `enable_dump_args=2` capture can
overrun the DFX collector before it finalizes. Captured model inputs remain an
optional validation path for small workloads.

The input `kernel.cpp` must contain the synchronization that will execute on
device. Prefer the `.cpp` emitted by the normal PyPTO/PTOAS compile. If starting
from a pre-InsertSync level-3 `.pto`, regenerate the source with
`--enable-insert-sync`; in the same PTOAS invocation, write an InsertSync
summary and require it to match the topology being studied. Timing a source
generated from pre-sync PTO without this flag is invalid even when it happens
to run correctly.

For ablations, run `prepare_dsa_ablation.py --help` with `dsa_expert_placement_study_v1.json`.
It verifies fingerprints, hard geometry, exact moves, and placement legality,
then writes full replay-ready solution sets and an overlap/objective report. PyPTO
replay remains the authoritative C++ validator before codegen.

For a single buffer-pair experiment, construct the disjoint/overlapping pair
and its translated address control jointly:

```bash
python .claude/skills/incore-profiling/construct_dsa_pair_isolation.py \
  --problem <problem.dsa.json> --base-solution <base.dsa.solution.json> \
  --first-buffer <id> --second-buffer <id> --output-root <out>
```

The constructor preserves each target's complete overlap signature with every
unrelated buffer and emits `D0`, `O0`, `D1`, and `O1` only when the two disjoint
geometries and two overlapping geometries match exactly. Replay still provides
the authoritative compiler-side validation.

For repeatable campaigns, store launch metadata in one portable invocation
profile. It keeps exact scalar bounds and nonzero control inputs identical:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "block_dim": 1,
  "input": {"kind": "synthetic", "seed": 19},
  "scalars": {"v4": 0, "v5": 0, "v6": 256},
  "pointer_fills": {"v1": 32},
  "outputs": ["v3"]
}
```

Preflight a baseline/candidate pair before using a device:

```bash
python .claude/skills/incore-profiling/preflight_standalone_comparison.py \
  --baseline-build <baseline-build> --candidate-build <candidate-build> \
  --function <kernel> --invocation-profile invocation.json \
  --ptoas-bin <instrumented-ptoas> --ptoas-root <PTOAS-checkout> \
  --output-root <preflight>
```

This resolves the target from persisted PTO, regenerates both C++ sources with
InsertSync, checks summaries, inputs, ABI, and launch metadata, and writes
`preflight.json`. Add `--build-npu --pto-isa-root <pto-isa>` on a host with
CANN to compile both standalone executables using two workers. Then run:

```bash
python .claude/skills/incore-profiling/standalone_compare.py \
  --compact-case <compact-case> --loose-case <loose-case> \
  --output <real-output-abi-name> --device-id 0 \
  --quartets 8 --warmup 10 --rounds 100 --output-root <results>
```

Synthetic inputs are bounded and emitted in chunks. Integer pointers default to
zero; use `pointer_fills` or file inputs when kernels require indices,
sentinels, or positive extents. For pure NPU kernels, the generator also bounds
post-PTOAS `GlobalTensor` partition offsets across loops and SPMD blocks. It
allocates the complete physical span and rejects unresolved expressions or file
inputs shorter than that span. Every scalar must satisfy tensor-view bounds.

Mixed AIC/AIV inputs are launched as one co-scheduled group. They require
`--ptoas-root`; the generator reuses PTOAS's validation-harness wrapper, which
merges both bodies and their shared pipe objects into one global kernel. It
never launches an AIC or AIV half in isolation. PyPTO's synthetic block-index,
block-count, and AIV-lane parameters are removed from the host ABI and rebound
to direct-launch hardware builtins. In particular, the two vector lanes receive
distinct `get_subblockid()` values rather than one host-provided scalar.

For a small workload where exact model values matter, use
`--args-dump <args_dump.json> --func-id <id> --task-id <id>` instead of
`--synthetic-inputs`. Import rejects mixed AIC/AIV, incomplete, non-contiguous,
ambiguous, or truncated captures.

For large workloads, capture exact dispatch scalars without copying tensor
payloads. Run the parent once with `RunConfig.enable_dump_args=3` (or the
equivalent harness `--dump-args 3`), then combine the resulting JSON-only
manifest with bounded synthetic pointer inputs:

```bash
python .claude/skills/incore-profiling/gen_profiling_case.py \
  --input <kernel.cpp> --testcase <name> --output-root <out> \
  --run-mode npu --synthetic-inputs \
  --dispatch-dump <args_dump.json> --func-id <id> --task-id <id>
```

Level 3 records every task's tensor metadata and scalar values, but emits no
`args.bin`, so it does not reproduce the full-dump collector runaway on large
models. The recovered values are the actual kernel ABI scalars after
orchestration has evaluated loop indices and tensor reads. Pointer contents
remain synthetic unless supplied separately; use `pointer_fills` or file inputs
when data-dependent control tensors affect the path being measured.

The driver verifies ABI, launch metadata, inputs, and captured outputs. It
restores inputs per launch, times with `aclrtEventElapsedTime`, runs serial ABBA
quartets, and writes `samples.tsv` plus `report.json`.

For broad DSA studies, use model compilation only to discover about 20
high-signal kernels or mixed groups. Rank by sync change, removed reuse pairs,
and useful work; exclude unchanged, trivial, and failed cases.

CANN, the camodel SoC, and the compile arch are auto-resolved from `--target`.
Override any of them with `--cann-set-env`, `--soc-version`, `--aicore-arch`.

## Output

Each run writes to `<build-dir>/kernel_insight_all_funcs_<timestamp>/`:

- `manifest_export.csv` and `summary.txt` — index and per-kernel status.
- `funcs/<kernel>/collect/out/OPPROF_*/simulator/` — Insight traces and
  per-core instruction data.

A final `EXPORTED N/M` line reports how many kernels succeeded.

### Clean and store the trace

```bash
python -m pypto.tools.clean_sim_trace \
  <build-dir>/kernel_insight_all_funcs_<ts>/funcs/<kernel>/collect/out/OPPROF_* -o <out>
```

Store the result under gitignored
`build_output/incore_<kernel>_<source>_<timestamp>/`, not `/tmp`. Preserve the
clean trace, instruction metrics, raw simulator data, and a provenance summary
that records inputs and scalars.

## Troubleshooting

- **`__biasbuf__` / `aicore` compile errors** — select a TL-capable CANN with
  `--cann-set-env`.
- **Build fails inside `pto/npu/a5/*.hpp`** — wrong target; pass `--target a2a3`
  for an A2/A3 device.
- **Missing `runtime_camodel`** — select the installed variant with
  `--soc-version`, commonly `Ascend910B1`.
- **Trace is ~0 cycles / `CUBE=0` / only SCALAR+sync instrs** — the kernel is
  data-dependent and its control input is invalid; use an invocation profile.
- **Missing CANN or `msopprof`** — pass the corresponding explicit path.
- **Missing sibling `.pto`** — use a complete `ptoas/` directory or the full
  validation generator through `--ptoas-root`.

## Caveats

Synthetic integer inputs can make data-dependent loops execute zero times. A
near-empty or `CUBE=0` trace is not performance evidence; replace control inputs
and scalar bounds with a real workload. NPU capture mode does this automatically.

## How it works

The generator derives ABI and physical spans from `.cpp`/`.pto`, emits the
harness, builds, runs `msprof op simulator`, and records each kernel
independently. Mixed NPU kernels use PTOAS's co-scheduled validation wrapper.
