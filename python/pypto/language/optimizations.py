"""Optimization config entries for ``pl.at(..., optimizations=[...])``.

Each entry is an orthogonal optimization hint applied to the enclosing scope.
The entries can be combined freely in the ``optimizations=`` list.

Available entries:
    - ``pl.split(mode)`` — Cross-core data-transfer split hint, consumed by
      the ``ExpandMixedKernel`` pass. Lowers the scope to ``InCore`` with
      ``split_=mode``.
    - ``pl.auto_chunk`` — Request compiler-driven outlining of chunked
      parallel loops. Lowers the scope to ``AutoInCore`` so that the
      ``InterchangeChunkLoops`` pass can interchange and outline chunked
      loops within it.

These two entries are independent and may be combined::

    with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP,
               optimizations=[pl.auto_chunk, pl.split(pl.SplitMode.UP_DOWN)]):
        ...

    """Cross-core data-transfer split hint.

    Sets ``ScopeStmt::split_`` on the enclosing ``pl.at`` scope; that metadata
    is consumed by the ``ExpandMixedKernel`` pass via the outlined function's
    ``SplitMode``. The split hint is independent of the resulting scope kind:

    - ``optimizations=[pl.split(mode)]`` → ``ScopeKind::InCore`` (split metadata).
    - ``optimizations=[pl.auto_chunk, pl.split(mode)]`` → ``ScopeKind::AutoInCore``
      (split metadata still attached).

    Args:
        mode: Split mode (``SplitMode.NONE``, ``SplitMode.UP_DOWN``, or
            ``SplitMode.LEFT_RIGHT``).
        slot_num: Optional cross-core ring-buffer depth for the automatic
            cube→vector pipe inserted by ``ExpandMixedKernel``. ``None`` keeps
            the PTOAS-derived default (8 unidirectional, 4 per direction
            bidirectional). When set, both the reserved buffer
            (``slot_size * slot_num``) and the emitted ``initialize_pipe``
            ``slot_num`` attribute use this value. Valid with any ``mode``,
            including ``SplitMode.NONE``: a NONE mixed kernel still drives a
            cube→vector pipe (on Ascend910B via dual-AIV dispatch), so
            ``slot_num`` sizes that ring regardless of split mode. It is ignored
            only when the outlined scope ends up with no cross-core ops.
