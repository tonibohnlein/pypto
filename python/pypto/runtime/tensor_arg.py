"""``make_tensor_arg`` used by generated distributed orchestration code.

The generated ``orchestration/host_orch.py`` builds simpler ``TaskArgs`` by
calling ``make_tensor_arg(tensors["<name>"])`` for every tensor parameter.
This pypto-owned wrapper widens that conversion to also accept worker-resident
:class:`~pypto.runtime.DeviceTensor` handles (and already-built simpler
``Tensor`` values), so distributed programs can be invoked with
pre-uploaded device buffers — mirroring the L2 path in
:func:`pypto.runtime.runner.execute_compiled`.

Host ``torch.Tensor`` arguments are delegated unchanged to simpler's
``make_tensor_arg``; only the device-resident branches are added here.

              simpler's ``make_tensor_arg``, which performs the H2D copy).

              skips H2D/D2H (memory is caller-managed).

    Returns:
        A simpler ``Tensor`` ready to add to ``TaskArgs``.
