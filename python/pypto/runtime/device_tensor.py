"""User-facing handle to worker-resident device memory.

A :class:`DeviceTensor` is an opaque ``(data_ptr, shape, dtype)`` triple bound
to a specific :class:`~pypto.runtime.Worker`'s address space.  Pass it to
:class:`~pypto.ir.compiled_program.CompiledProgram` in place of a
``torch.Tensor`` to skip the host→device copy on entry and the device→host
copy on exit — the runtime treats the underlying buffer as already resident
on the worker (``Tensor.child_memory == 1``).

Lifetime is **caller-managed**: every :meth:`~pypto.runtime.Worker.malloc`
(or :meth:`~pypto.runtime.Worker.alloc_tensor`) must be paired with a
matching :meth:`~pypto.runtime.Worker.free` (or
:meth:`~pypto.runtime.Worker.free_tensor`) before the Worker is closed.

Because no D2H copy happens for a ``DeviceTensor``, callers that want to
read the data back must do so explicitly via
:meth:`~pypto.runtime.Worker.copy_from`.

    (L3). The ``malloc`` / ``copy_to`` / ``free`` callables are injected with
    any ``worker_id`` already bound, so this helper stays free of worker scope.

    When *init* is provided its dtype and shape must match exactly. The host
    buffer actually uploaded is ``init_prep(init)``: the default makes a
    defensive contiguous CPU copy (L2), while L3 overrides it to *reject* a copy
    and require ``init`` already be shared memory (the upload runs in a forked
    child that can only see host memory inherited at fork). If any step after
    ``malloc`` raises, the allocation is rolled back via ``free`` before the
    exception propagates so callers never observe a leaked pointer.

        malloc: ``malloc(nbytes) -> device_ptr``.
        copy_to: ``copy_to(dst_dev_ptr, src_host_ptr, nbytes) -> None`` (H2D).
