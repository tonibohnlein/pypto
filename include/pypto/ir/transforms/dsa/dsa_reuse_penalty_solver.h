/**
 * @file
 * @brief IR-independent capacity-constrained DSA with weighted reuse penalties.
 *
 * The model is deliberately limited to the structure produced by PyPTO after
 * semantic aliases have been materialized: each buffer belongs to one fixed
 * memory pool and has one conservative half-open lifetime. Correctness
 * constraints are hard. A reuse penalty is activated when two lifetime-
 * compatible buffers occupy overlapping byte ranges.
 *
 * For R configured orders, the constructive search runs in
 * O(R * n^2 log n): each buffer considers O(n) canonical boundary offsets,
 * while hard-range feasibility and soft-overlap scoring are indexed. The
 * input hard/soft relation graph can itself contain O(n^2) edges. This is a
 * storage-allocation algorithm over tens to low hundreds of buffers, not a
 * nested traversal over PyPTO IR.
