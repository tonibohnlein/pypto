# MaterializeCommDomainScopes Pass

## Overview

`MaterializeCommDomainScopes` walks each host-orchestration function and assembles the
host-side metadata that the distributed runtime needs in order to size and
populate per-rank communication windows. It is the structural analogue of
[`InitMemRef`](34-init_memref.md): it traces an allocation through to its
consumption points, constructs a back-reference object, and threads it onto
the IR types so downstream codegen has O(1) access.

| Aspect | `MemRef` side | `WindowBuffer` side |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Allocation op | `tile.alloc(memory_space, size_in_bytes)` | `pld.tensor.alloc_window_buffer(size_in_bytes)` |
| Assignment LHS at parse time | `Var(PtrType)` | `Var(PtrType)` (same singleton) |
| Wrapper Var subclass | `MemRef` | `WindowBuffer` |
| Wrapper's SSA-edge type | `MemRefType` (singleton) | `WindowBufferType` (singleton) |
| Built by | `InitMemRef` | **`MaterializeCommDomainScopes`** (this pass) |
| Threaded back onto | `TensorType.memref_` | `DistributedTensorType.window_buffer_` |
| IR-level registry | `Program.functions_` (alloc stmts) | `CommDomainScopeStmt` wrapping each host_orch body (one per inferred comm domain) |

## Position in the pipeline

```text
... -> ExpandManualPhaseFence -> SynthesizeAllReduceSignals -> MaterializeCommDomainScopes -> LowerHostTensorCollectives -> MaterializeDistTensorCtx -> Simplify (final)
```

The pass runs near the end of the default pipeline, immediately before
[`LowerHostTensorCollectives`](48-lower_host_tensor_collectives.md) and the final
`Simplify`. None of the intervening passes between `InlineFunctions` and here
touches the host_orch alloc/window/dispatch chain: host_orch is never
tile-lowered, and L2 (chip-level) orchestrations are never inlined into L3, so
the alloc / view / dispatch sites this pass needs are still discoverable. Running
late keeps the producing IR fully canonicalised before the descriptor analysis
kicks in, and any constant folding that the trailing `Simplify` does on the
collected sizes is applied uniformly.

## Algorithm

For every host-orchestration function (`Function::level_ == Level::HOST` and
`Function::role_ == Role::Orchestrator`, regardless of `func_type_`):

1. **Collect allocations.** Find every `AssignStmt` whose RHS is a
   `pld.tensor.alloc_window_buffer(size, *, name)` Call. Record `(ptr_var, size_expr,
   name, span, call)`.

2. **Collect views.** For every `AssignStmt` whose RHS is a
   `pld.tensor.window(ptr_var, [shape], *, dtype)` Call referencing a recorded
   `ptr_var`, record the binding `view_var → alloc`.

3. **Scan dispatches.** Walk the body with a stack of enclosing `ForStmt`s.
   For every Call whose `op_` is a `GlobalVar` resolving to a chip-level
   orchestration, read `attrs["device"]` and infer a **device descriptor**
   from the device expression in the current loop context:

   | `device=` shape | Descriptor |
   | --------------- | ---------- |
   | `ConstInt(N)` | `subset = {N}` |
   | `IterArg of for r in pl.range(pld.system.world_size())` | `kAll` |
   | `IterArg of for r in pl.range(ConstInt(N))` | `subset = {0, …, N − 1}` |
   | other | `pypto::ValueError` |

   Every positional dispatch arg that is a recorded view Var contributes that
   descriptor to its underlying allocation.

4. **Merge descriptors.** Per allocation, fold every recorded descriptor:
   any `kAll` ⇒ `kAll`; otherwise union the subsets. A host-level collective's
   signal (and, for `pld.tensor.all_to_all_v`, its `recv_counts`) carries no
   `device=` of its own, so it inherits device coverage from the collective's
   paired data/target allocation instead — a call may register more than one
   such pairing sharing the same data allocation (`all_to_all_v` registers two:
   one for `signal`, one for `recv_counts`).

5. **Materialise `WindowBuffer`s.** For each allocation construct
   `WindowBuffer(base = ptr_var, size = size_expr, load_from_host = false,
   store_to_host = false)`. The `Var::name_hint_` is inherited from
   `ptr_var->name_hint_`. (Host-staging flags are placeholders for N4+.)

6. **Rewrite view types** *(host_orch only)*. For every view binding, mint a
   fresh `Var` of the same `name_hint_` whose type is
   `DistributedTensorType(shape, dtype, memref, tensor_view, wb)` and run
   `Substitute` to swap every reference to the old view Var with the fresh
   one. `Substitute` rewrites *references* only, so the Call that defines each
   re-typed Var is then re-minted with the same `window_buffer_`-bearing type —
   otherwise the assignment ends the pass with the back-reference on its LHS
   and not on its RHS, violating
   [`AssignTypeSymmetry`](99-verifier.md#built-in-rules). The re-mint only ever
   *adds* the back-reference: it keeps the rebuilt type only when that type is
   structurally equal to the Var's, so a genuine shape / dtype / view
   disagreement is left for the verifier to report. Two `pld.tensor.window`
   views over the same allocation share the same
   `shared_ptr<const WindowBuffer>`. Chip-orch / InCore parameter types are
   not touched.

7. **Cluster into comm domains.** Walk the allocation list in source order;
   append a slot to the first existing comm domain whose merged device
   descriptor matches, or open a new one.

8. **Wrap the body in scope statements.** Build a chain of nested
   `CommDomainScopeStmt`s — one per comm domain, outer = first declared,
   inner = last — and substitute it for the host_orch function body. Each
   scope carries its `devices` list and its slot vector; `name_hint_` is
   set to `"comm_d<n>"` so codegen emits the matching `__comm_d<n>` handle
   variable verbatim.

## Sanity checks

The pass raises `pypto::ValueError` (carrying the alloc's span) if:

- An allocation has no `pld.tensor.window` materialisation (dead alloc).
- An allocation has at least one view but no chip-orch dispatch consumes it.
- The `device=` expression on a dispatch is something other than `ConstInt`
  or a recognised `pl.range` induction var.
- Two allocations within the same comm domain share a `name_hint_` (the
  parser already enforces global uniqueness; the pass re-asserts).
- A `pld.tensor.all_to_all_v` call sits inside a `for`/`while` loop in a HOST
  orchestrator — dynamic re-invocation needs loop-carried window lifetime
  management this compiler does not model yet (the credit-based signal itself
  is reusable across sequential calls); same restriction `LowerCompositeOps`
  enforces on the InCore path.

## Output invariants

After the pass:

- Every host_orch function whose body contains at least one alloc has its
  body wrapped in a chain of nested `CommDomainScopeStmt`s (one per
  inferred comm domain, outer = first declared, inner = last).
  Allocation-free host_orchs are left unchanged.
- Every `pld.tensor.window` result Var's type is a `DistributedTensorType` whose
  `window_buffer_` field points to the corresponding `WindowBuffer`, and the
  defining Call carries that same type — both sides of the assignment agree.
- Every host-level `pld.tensor.allreduce` call has two positional arguments
  after [`SynthesizeAllReduceSignals`](46-synthesize_allreduce_signals.md) runs.
  For an omitted user signal, the second argument is a synthesized Var produced
  by a preceding `pld.tensor.window` assignment.
- `pld.tensor.window` views over the same allocation share the same
  `shared_ptr<const WindowBuffer>` — pointer-equality is a load-bearing
  invariant for downstream codegen.
- Chip-orchestration and InCore parameter types remain `nullopt` on
  `window_buffer_`. N7 codegen reads the back-reference at the *host_orch*
  dispatch site and threads the matching `CommContext` pointer explicitly.

## Text round-trip

The ordinary authoring DSL continues to infer communication domains. Printed IR
records the materialized state using private `pl._dump` spellings:

- `comm_domain(name=..., devices=..., slots=[...], attrs={...})` preserves the
  scope boundary, device list, ordered slots, and attributes.
- `window_buffer("buf_window", base="buf", size=16, load_from_host=..., store_to_host=...)`
  defines a slot; `window_ref("buf_window")` refers to that same object from tensor types.
  The label is a text-format reference, not a device ID, slot index, or IR field.
  Labels derive from the printed base variable; suffixes distinguish different
  windows sharing that base. Earlier numeric IDs remain readable.
- `alloc_window_buffer(size, name=...)` preserves the allocation's logical name
  independently of an SSA-renamed result variable.
- `call(op, args, result_type, kwargs=..., attrs=...)` restores a Call directly,
  accepting any result type supported by the type parser. The printer uses it
  for distributed calls whose recorded type must be preserved, including an
  absent back-reference; inference can differ after a pass rewrites the operands.

The parser records window descriptors before parsing the body and resolves them
when their allocation and size expressions are available. Scope slots and tensor
back-references share one reconstructed `WindowBuffer`. These spellings are IR
text syntax, not operations that execute in a kernel.
The descriptor's `base` names the allocation variable defined in the body;
`window_buffer(...)` adds no allocation statement. Its `size` and the allocation
Call's size argument are separate recorded IR fields and are both retained.
Empty scopes print `pass`. Scalar attribute literals such as `-1` remain scalars;
`pl.const(-1, pl.INDEX)` records an IR expression instead.

For a self-contained program, `parse(python_print(program))` must be structurally
equal to `program`, with equal structural hashes. No lowering pass is rerun by
the parser or required from the caller. Statement fragments with references to
absent definitions are outside this contract. Legacy informational
`"window_buffer=<name>"` markers remain readable but do not encode a reference.
