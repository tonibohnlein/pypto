# AllocateMemoryAddr Pass

Assigns real memory addresses to existing alloc operations.

## Overview

This pass is the physical-address boundary for non-DDR MemRefs. It resolves
`system.reserve_buffer(base=AUTO)`, chooses placements, and updates the existing
`tile.alloc` statements before PTO code generation. It never creates allocation
operations: InitMemRef has already created them with unallocated addresses.

The default `MemoryPlanner.PYPTO` path keeps the existing aligned bump placement
after MemoryReuse. The optional `MemoryPlanner.DSA` path receives the unmerged
allocation identities, exports the same structured problem used by the benchmark
framework, invokes the standalone solver, independently validates its result, and
writes the validated offsets back.

**Key responsibilities**:

- Collect unique MemRef objects from TileType variables
- Resolve `system.reserve_buffer` bases to explicit addresses per function
- Allocate sequential, 32-byte aligned addresses within each memory space
- Or, in DSA mode, jointly choose lifetime reuse and offsets with the standalone solver
- Update MemRef addresses in all variable types
- Update `tile.alloc` statement arguments with the allocated addresses

**When to use**: Run before code generation as the final memory-management pass.
The default pipeline runs it after MemoryReuse. The DSA pipeline deliberately
skips MemoryReuse, but still runs MaterializeSemanticAliases first so views,
loop-carried values, and in-place operations retain their mandatory identities.

## Planner modes

| Mode | Input to this pass | Placement | Failure behavior |
| ---- | ------------------ | --------- | ---------------- |
| `MemoryPlanner.PYPTO` | Opportunistically merged MemRefs from MemoryReuse | Backend-policy aligned bump allocation | Existing verifier reports invalid or over-capacity addresses |
| `MemoryPlanner.DSA` | Unmerged MemRefs after MaterializeSemanticAliases | Standalone schema-v1 DSA solver: first-fit initialization, canonical greedy for explicitly recognized reuse costs, bounded structured search otherwise, and explicit pipeline-intent relaxation only when the strict problem does not fit | Invalid export, capability mismatch, infeasibility, or validator failure stops compilation; no silent fallback |
| `MemoryPlanner.PTOAS` | None | This pass is skipped; ptoas `PlanMemory` owns placement | Deferred to ptoas |

DSA support is an optional CMake dependency. Build and consume an installed
`dsa-solver` 0.10 package as follows:

```bash
cmake -S /path/to/dsa-solver -B /path/to/dsa-solver/build \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/dsa-install
cmake --build /path/to/dsa-solver/build --parallel 2
cmake --install /path/to/dsa-solver/build

cmake -B build -DPYPTO_ENABLE_DSA_SOLVER=ON \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/dsa-install
cmake --build build --parallel 2
```

The default build keeps `PYPTO_ENABLE_DSA_SOLVER=OFF`. It still exposes the
planner enum so configuration can be serialized consistently, but selecting DSA
at execution time produces an actionable error explaining how to reconfigure.
`passes.is_dsa_solver_available()` reports whether the active build includes the
adapter, allowing optional tests and applications to gate DSA selection.

## API

| C++ | Python | Level |
| --- | ------ | ----- |
| `pass::AllocateMemoryAddr()` | `passes.allocate_memory_addr()` | Function-level |

**Factory function**:

```cpp
Pass AllocateMemoryAddr();
```

**Python usage**:

```python
from pypto.pypto_core import passes

alloc_pass = passes.allocate_memory_addr()
program_with_addrs = alloc_pass(program)
```

Select the standalone path and optionally emit deterministic corpus documents
through PassContext-owned configuration:

```python
from pypto.pypto_core import passes

with passes.PassContext(
    [],
    memory_planner=passes.MemoryPlanner.DSA,
    dsa_export_dir="build/dsa-corpus",
    dsa_reuse_penalty_recognizer=passes.DsaReusePenaltyRecognizer.QUADRATIC,
):
    program_with_addrs = passes.allocate_memory_addr()(program)
```

Full compilation accepts the same selection as
`ir.compile(..., memory_planner=passes.MemoryPlanner.DSA,
dsa_export_dir="build/dsa-corpus")`.
`RunConfig` exposes the same `memory_planner` and `dsa_export_dir` fields. Set
`dsa_solution_dir` to replay a recorded placement rather than invoking the
solver. The placement is accepted only when its fingerprint matches the freshly
exported problem and independent validation succeeds. The
experimental `dsa_reuse_penalty_recognizer` is disabled by default. `QUADRATIC`
is the only enabled research mode and prioritizes coverage: it derives abstract
source/destination routes from resolved
memory spaces, then compares per-resource terminal-access and initial-write
frontiers for all lifetime-compatible allocation pairs, including nested and
distance-one loop handoffs. Each abstract resource is modeled as one
completion-ordered issue chain. Real SSA def-use is also an existing completion
dependency; for nested accesses it is tested through their representatives in
the nearest common enclosing region, so an `if`/loop result consumed afterward
is not mistaken for an independent access. Bare lexical statement order is not.
The initial frontier is the complete antichain of accesses minimal under those
relations, rather than the lexically first access. Partial-view and
same-operation handoffs are reported
but remain unpriced. The experimental v4 policy first constructs one soft edge
per qualifying cross-resource buffer pair, then applies a separate experimental
unit-weight model. Complete distance-zero handoffs inside structured control
are eligible; this covers the nested M-to-MTE1 mechanism observed in device
experiments. Same-resource, loop-carried, partial-range, same-operation,
incompletely observed, conservatively anchored, and already completion-ordered
records remain report-only.
Operation-registry effects distinguish execution-time accesses from declarations
and metadata-only views; mutating inherit-input operations and tuple outputs
remain visible to the access frontier. Weight calibration is a separate modeling
step. This is a PyPTO-stage approximation of maximal-access-to-first-write
hazard construction: PyPTO does not yet have PTOAS's final completion streams,
pre-existing inserted synchronizations, or calibrated stream-pair costs, so it
does not claim the vector-clock precision of a post-scheduling implementation.
Targets with multiple independently completing channels for one abstract
resource will require that resource to be split before promotion.

The construction is deterministic:

1. Collect execution-time reads and writes for each physical allocation,
   resolving tuple results, mutating operations, base allocations, and byte
   ranges.
2. Map each access to an abstract source/destination route and execution
   resource.
3. Retain maximal terminal accesses and the complete minimal initial-access
   antichain. Require every minimal access to be a verified write; otherwise
   keep the candidate report-only.
4. Compare lifetime-disjoint allocations in the same address space, including
   compatible nested control and explicit distance-one loop handoffs.
5. Record every candidate with its WAR/WAW, route, range, control, and ordering
   evidence. Construct a pair edge only from complete, full-range,
   distance-zero cross-resource evidence; assign its weight afterward.

For controlled placement studies, `dsa_reference_placement=COMPACT` labels the
normal validated DSA result, while `LOOSE` greedily reduces physical reuse
without exceeding capacity. `dsa_reference_target="name"` applies `LOOSE` only
to that exact function and keeps sibling kernels compact. Each endpoint is
constructed and validated within the compilation that emits it, avoiding
cross-compilation placement replay when generated function identities are
unstable. These are
experimental measurement endpoints, not production solver policies, and cannot
be combined with `dsa_solution_dir`.

The
system-test harness additionally accepts `--memory-planner=dsa` and
`--dsa-export-dir=...` for suite-wide device validation and corpus capture, or
`--dsa-solution-dir=...` for exact A/B placement replay. Add
`--ptoas-sync-summary-dir=...` to retain one machine-readable PTOAS InsertSync
summary per codegen unit, allowing two valid placements to be compared using
the same downstream synchronization accounting. This option requires a PTOAS
build containing the `--pto-insert-sync-summary` experiment flag.

The default export is `pypto_hard_v1`: standard DSA geometry with fixed memory
spaces, one conservative allocation-lifetime hull, capacities/reservations,
alignment, and typed separations. Lifetime-disjoint buffers may partially reuse
freed regions, including the subdivision required by #1908. If strict pipeline
intent does not fit, the adapter explicitly creates a cost-aware
`pypto_research_v1` relaxation and emits `PH-DSA-001`. Legacy
`pypto_structured` documents remain readable in the standalone tools but are no
longer emitted. The complete problem and objective definition is maintained by
the standalone solver in
[PyPTO and Dynamic Storage Allocation](https://github.com/tonibohnlein/dsa-solver/blob/main/docs/pypto_dsa.md).

## Algorithm

1. **Collect MemRefs**: Traverse function body to find all unique MemRef objects from TileType variables
2. **Group by memory space**: Organize MemRefs by memory space (Vec, Mat, Left, Right, Acc)
3. **Resolve reserve buffers**: For each function, scan `system.reserve_buffer` calls, assign explicit bases to AUTO buffers, and compute the reserved end address per memory space
4. **Allocate addresses**: For each memory space, delegate to a `MemoryAllocatorPolicy` to filter spaces, order MemRefs, and align addresses. The default policy sorts by ID, uses 32-byte alignment, and starts from the reserved end (or `0`)
5. **Update in place**: Use `MemRefUpdateMutator` to:
   - Replace old MemRef references in variable types (TileType/TensorType) with new MemRefs containing real addresses
   - Update existing `tile.alloc` `AssignStmt`s: replace LHS MemRef and update addr argument in the Call expression
   - Rewrite `system.reserve_buffer` kwargs with the resolved explicit `base`

### Standalone DSA path

When `MemoryPlanner.DSA` is active, step 4 is replaced by this guarded path:

1. Reuse the phi/loop-aware lifetime analysis from MemoryReuse without running
   its opportunistic coalescer.
2. Export one buffer per mandatory `MemRef.base_` identity. The buffer size is
   the largest member size, so differently sized values may occupy that identity
   over its lifetime. The exported lifetime is the conservative allocation hull
   from the earliest member definition through the latest member use. Individual
   SSA-member gaps are not treated as physical dead time: loop carries, views,
   and in-place aliases can preserve a value across such a gap. Multi-interval
   reuse requires a separate proof that the physical value is dead in each hole.
3. Convert PyPTO statement points into half-open read/write events. A definition
   starts at `2 * def + 1`; the final read ends at `2 * last_use + 1`. A value
   with no later read receives one write event. Consequently, an input's final
   read may share an address with the result written by that statement.
4. Export fixed memory pools, backend capacities, a leading reserved range, and
   hard separation pairs for pipeline clones, backend hazards, and op-specific
   no-alias rules. Every requested pipeline stage initially receives a distinct
   residue, and every cross-stage member pair is hard-separated. Each
   separation retains its typed source.
5. Retain normalized alias-class members and pipeline group/stage/residue data.
   This provenance does not change placement by itself.
6. When explicitly enabled, recognize potential false physical dependencies.
   The coverage-first quadratic reference maps resolved memory classes
   (`external`, `UB`, `L1`, `L0`) to abstract transfer/compute resources, then
   compares access frontiers for all lifetime-compatible pairs while preserving
   exact arenas, control-path, loop, and byte-range context. A terminal
   read or write followed by an initial write becomes a WAR or WAW candidate;
   same-resource issue order and real SSA def-use are existing completion
   dependencies, while lexical order alone is not. The experimental v4 policy
   promotes only complete, full-range, distance-zero cross-resource candidates
   to unit `cross_pipe` schema edges. Nested distance-zero candidates are
   eligible; same-resource, loop-carried, partial-range, conservatively
   anchored, and uncertain candidates remain report-only.
7. Validate the strict schema/profile and try deterministic first-fit. An
   explicitly enabled reuse recognizer sends its capacity-constrained cost
   problem to canonical greedy, which retains first-fit as a feasible
   incumbent; bounded PyPTO-structured search remains a no-fit fallback. Other
   searches retain that structured baseline. If no capacity-fitting placement
   is found, remove only the `pipeline_stage` reason, retain every correctness
   reason, add unit `pipeline_serialization` penalties, and solve the explicit
   research relaxation.
8. Validate
   every placement independently against sizes, alignment, lifetimes, pools,
   capacities, reserved ranges, and separations. Revalidate a relaxed solution
   against the strict problem to avoid warning when relaxed search happens to
   discover a strict-valid placement.
9. Write each placement back while preserving every view's relative byte
   offset. Emit `PH-DSA-001` when the final placement actually relaxes pipeline
   intent.

The version-1 adapter intentionally keeps pool assignment fixed. The strict
problem minimizes peak under capacity. The explicit fallback prioritizes
capacity, reuse cost, total peak, and maximum pool peak in that order. Branch
exclusivity that is not visible in the exported intervals remains conservative
rather than unsound. Buffers remain fixed-size allocations; subdivision comes
from jointly assigning offsets after an earlier region expires, not from
resizing a buffer during its lifetime.

Scheduling itself is also fixed before this pass, even though a different legal
schedule would produce different lifetimes. See
[Joint Scheduling and Local-Memory Planning](../proposals/joint_schedule_memory_cooptimization.md)
for the PyPTO-owned, PTOAS-owned, and cross-layer co-optimization options.

If `dsa_export_dir` is set, each InCore function produces:

- `pypto_<escaped-function-name>.dsa.json`: the deterministic problem;
- `pypto_<escaped-function-name>.dsa.solution.json`: the selected placement,
  its problem fingerprint, and solver metadata.

The problem contains no IR pointers or machine-specific paths and can be copied
into the standalone corpus. The solution artifact is the controlled seam for
solver/PTOAS A/B experiments: edit neither the compiler IR nor the problem;
generate a matching solution with `dsa-bench --solution-output`, then replay it
through `dsa_solution_dir`.

**Address allocation (default policy)**:

- Each memory space has its own address space starting from 0 unless `system.reserve_buffer` already reserved a leading window in that space
- Addresses are 32-byte aligned: `next_addr = align32(current_addr + size)`
- MemRefs are sorted by ID for deterministic allocation order
- DDR MemRefs are skipped (addresses managed externally)

**View MemRefs (slices) share one slot**:

MemRefs that share the same `base_` Ptr (a root allocation plus its `tile.slice` views) are co-located in a single slot sized by the largest member, since every view physically aliases its parent. Each member keeps its own relative offset within the slot: `new_addr = slot_base + member.byte_offset` (the relative offset InitMemRef computed). The root sits at `slot_base`; a view at row `k` sits at `slot_base + k * row_stride`. This matters for chains where a view's offset is not re-derived at codegen — e.g. a `tile.reshape` of a `tile.slice` does not emit `pto.subview`, so its `pto.alloc_tile addr` is read directly from this MemRef offset.

Backends can override these defaults by supplying a custom `MemoryAllocatorPolicy` via `Backend::CreateMemoryAllocatorPolicy()`. See [Allocation Policy](#allocation-policy) below.

## Example

### Before (after InitMemRef + MemoryReuse)

```python
# SeqStmts [
mem_vec_0: MemRefType = tile.alloc(Vec, -1, 16384, 0)   # addr=-1 (unallocated)
mem_vec_1: MemRefType = tile.alloc(Vec, -1, 16384, 1)   # addr=-1 (unallocated)
tile_a: Tile[[64, 64], FP32, memref=mem_vec_0] = tile.load(...)
tile_b: Tile[[64, 64], FP32, memref=mem_vec_1] = tile.add(tile_a, ...)
# ]
```

### After (addresses assigned)

```python
# SeqStmts [
mem_vec_0: MemRefType = tile.alloc(Vec, 0, 16384, 0)      # addr=0
mem_vec_1: MemRefType = tile.alloc(Vec, 16384, 16384, 1)   # addr=16384 (aligned)
tile_a: Tile[[64, 64], FP32, memref=mem_vec_0] = tile.load(...)
tile_b: Tile[[64, 64], FP32, memref=mem_vec_1] = tile.add(tile_a, ...)
# ]
```

### Multiple Memory Spaces

```python
# Before:
mem_vec_0: MemRefType = tile.alloc(Vec, -1, 2048, 0)
mem_left_1: MemRefType = tile.alloc(Left, -1, 2048, 1)
mem_right_2: MemRefType = tile.alloc(Right, -1, 2048, 2)
mem_acc_3: MemRefType = tile.alloc(Acc, -1, 2048, 3)

# After (each space starts from addr=0):
mem_vec_0: MemRefType = tile.alloc(Vec, 0, 2048, 0)
mem_left_1: MemRefType = tile.alloc(Left, 0, 2048, 1)
mem_right_2: MemRefType = tile.alloc(Right, 0, 2048, 2)
mem_acc_3: MemRefType = tile.alloc(Acc, 0, 2048, 3)
```

## Implementation

**Header**: `include/pypto/ir/transforms/passes.h`

```cpp
Pass AllocateMemoryAddr();
```

**Implementation**: `src/ir/transforms/allocate_memory_addr_pass.cpp`

- `memref_collectors::CollectMemRefsWithSpace` collects unique MemRefs and their memory spaces
- `AllocateMemoryAddresses` assigns sequential aligned addresses per memory space using a `MemoryAllocatorPolicy`
- `dsa_adapter::BuildStructuredProblem` exports the IR-free schema-v1 problem
- `dsa_adapter::Solve` capability-matches a selected standalone solver and independently validates
- the DSA path first enforces full requested pipeline depth; if no fitting
  placement is found, it explicitly relaxes only `pipeline_stage` separations,
  minimizes the resulting reuse costs, and emits `PH-DSA-001`
- `dsa_adapter::BuildMemRefReplacements` performs view-aware writeback
- `MemRefUpdateMutator` updates both variable types and `tile.alloc` statement arguments in a single traversal

**Python binding**: `python/bindings/modules/passes.cpp`

```cpp
passes.def("allocate_memory_addr", &pass::AllocateMemoryAddr,
           "Allocates real memory addresses for existing alloc operations.");
```

**Tests**: `tests/ut/ir/transforms/test_allocate_memory_addr_pass.py`

- Tests address allocation with 32-byte alignment
- Tests multiple MemRef allocations
- Tests empty function (no tiles)
- Tests alloc statements are prepended to the function body's top-level `SeqStmts`
- Tests raw pointer uniqueness for MemRef deduplication
- Tests default policy behavior without a backend configured
- Tests DSA read-before-write reuse, reserved ranges, view-offset writeback, and deterministic export
- Tests alias-class, typed separation, strict pipeline intent, explicit
  reuse-cost fallback, and its performance warning
- Replays the #1908 fragmentation shape through exporter, standalone solver, validator, and writeback

## Allocation Policy

The pass delegates placement decisions to a `MemoryAllocatorPolicy` interface (`include/pypto/ir/memory_allocator_policy.h`), making the allocation strategy extensible without modifying the pass itself.

### Interface

```cpp
class MemoryAllocatorPolicy {
 public:
  virtual ~MemoryAllocatorPolicy() = default;
  virtual bool ShouldAllocate(MemorySpace space) const = 0;
  virtual uint64_t AlignAddress(uint64_t addr, MemorySpace space) const = 0;
  virtual void OrderMemRefs(std::vector<MemRefPtr>& refs) const = 0;
};
```

| Method | Purpose | Default behavior |
| ------ | ------- | ---------------- |
| `ShouldAllocate` | Filter which memory spaces receive addresses | Skip DDR; allocate all on-chip spaces |
| `AlignAddress` | Align a raw address for a given space | 32-byte alignment |
| `OrderMemRefs` | Sort MemRefs within a space before allocation | Ascending by `MemRef::id_` |

### Default policy

`DefaultMemoryAllocatorPolicy` preserves the original hard-coded behavior (skip DDR, 32-byte alignment, sort by ID).

### Backend override

When a backend is configured (`BackendConfig::IsConfigured()`), the pass calls `Backend::CreateMemoryAllocatorPolicy()` to obtain the policy. The default `Backend` implementation returns `DefaultMemoryAllocatorPolicy`. Custom backends can override this virtual method to provide different alignment rules, ordering, or space filtering:

```cpp
class MyBackend : public Backend {
 public:
  MemoryAllocatorPolicyPtr CreateMemoryAllocatorPolicy() const override {
    return std::make_unique<MyCustomPolicy>();
  }
};
```

When no backend is configured (e.g., in unit tests), the pass falls back to `DefaultMemoryAllocatorPolicy` automatically.
