"""Runtime st for AutoTileMatmulL0's compiler-driven L0 tiling.

Validates on device the cases from examples/kernels/11_auto_tile_matmul.py:

  - **Oversized 2x2 matrix** -- an oversized ``[256, 256]`` FP32 output (> L0c) tiled and
    placed either to **DDR** (direct-store) or an **L1/Mat scratch** (consumed on-chip by a
    second matmul), each with **full-K** (K=32, k == K) or **split-K** reduction (K=128
    for direct-store, K=192 for the common cross-planner Mat-scratch split).
  - **Fits-L0c cast-fold** -- a chained ``(a @ b) @ e`` whose ``[128, 128]`` intermediate
    *fits* L0c (no M/N tiling); the ``pl.cast`` is folded into a single full-window Acc->Mat
    ``pto.tinsert``, so the bf16 downcast stays on the cube. full-K (K=64) and split-K (K=512).

Golden: torch. This is the on-device validation the unit / codegen / pto-verify checks cannot
give (actual execution). Ascend910B (``a2a3``): the Mat-scratch / fits-L0c Acc->Mat lowering is
the 910B bf16 ``pto.tinsert`` FIXPIPE path (the f32 accumulator is downcast into the bf16
scratch); the a5 f32 converting-``pto.tmov`` assemble is a separate lowering.

        Run under both planners.  The PTOAS variants provide regression coverage
        for #1995: the chained consumer's K-reduction accumulator if-phi must reuse
        the dominating accumulator handle so all partial sums land in one L0C buffer.

        K=192 is the common cross-planner split point: both planners choose an
        output-stationary producer with k=64, so its L0 buffers pack against the
        consumer's. K=128 is planner-dependent (PyPTO splits while PTOAS can keep full K)
        and can select a monolithic A/B-stationary buffer that the consumer's two
        half-size buffers cannot pack against. The pass deliberately avoids that
        issue-1908 regime by forcing chained Mat-scratch producers output-stationary.

        Operands are bf16 and the on-chip intermediate is bf16 — the cube's FIXPIPE
        writeback to L1 downcasts the f32 accumulator, which is also the cube's native
        operand precision. The golden models that downcast, so the tolerance is bf16."""
