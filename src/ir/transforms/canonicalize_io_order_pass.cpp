/**
 * @brief Mutator that reorders every multi-stmt ``SeqStmts`` in the program.
 *
 * Layered priority (top → bottom) is a hardware-unit stage ladder: scalar
 * compute, loads, (producer) tile compute, cross-core push, cross-core pop,
 * (consumer) tile compute, stores — all subject to the dependency graph.
 * Lifting scalar compute (typically address arithmetic) above loads ensures
 * sibling clones' loads become ready together and cluster at the top; the same
 * clustering across the cross-core stages keeps sibling cross-core tiles
 * co-live — the layout ``MemoryReuse`` needs for ping-pong (issue #1610).
 *
 * Soundness precondition (InOut-use discipline) is validated once per function
 * by the driver before the mutator runs, so per-region checks are unnecessary
 * here. Keeping the check out of the visitor avoids O(function-size) work for
 * every nested ``SeqStmts`` we visit.
