// LowerAutoVectorSplit (RFC #1300 staged convergence)
// ===================================================
//
// Converts an AUTO ``pl.split`` mixed InCore function into the EXPLICIT
// ``split_aiv`` form *before* ExpandMixedKernel, so that ExpandMixedKernel's
// op-driven boundary arm folds tile.aiv_shard / tile.aic_gather into
// split-stamped tpush/tpop uniformly — the same path hand-authored explicit
// kernels take. Once that conversion happens, the downstream SplitVectorKernel
// no longer needs to halve the body: it sees the ``split_aiv`` marker and only
// stamps attributes (its "already explicit" arm).
//
// This is the LIVE auto-split lowering path: it always runs in the pipeline,
// immediately before ExpandMixedKernel. After it runs, every split function
// reaches SplitVectorKernel already ``split_aiv``-marked, so SplitVectorKernel's
// former per-op halving driver is no longer needed (it was deleted once this
// pass became unconditional — the halving machinery now lives only in
// split_axis_utils, shared by this pass).
//
// Algorithm (per mixed InCore function carrying a function-level split mode M,
// M != None, that is not already ``split_aiv``):
//   1. Per-statement affinity via core_affinity::ClassifyCallAffinity.
//   2. Find C<->V boundaries: a C/V-crossing tile.move (ClassifyMoveDirection).
//   3. C->V boundary: replace with tile.aiv_shard(full_cube_tile, split=int(M))
//      -> HALF; seed the shard result into tile_vars like tpop_from_aic.
//   4. V->C boundary: insert tile.aic_gather(half_vector_tile, split=int(M))
//      -> FULL, then keep the original cube placement move on the full tile.
//   5. Halve ONLY the vector sub-region (AFFINITY GATE): a tile-producing op is
//      halved iff it is VECTOR-affine. CUBE-affine ops (matmul operands, the
//      cube result before the C->V boundary) stay FULL. We assert no CUBE op was
//      halved.
//   6. Inject get_subblock_idx + stamp split + split_aiv so StampTfreeSplit /
//      codegen / the AivSplitVerifier read it.

// statement onto BOTH lanes, double-firing a non-idempotent side effect such as
// pld.system.notify. The stamp is that carrier; ``ClassifyCallAffinity`` reads
// it as the placement authority. See kCorePlacementAttr (attrs.h) for the
// pass 23 -> pass 24 lifetime, and ExpandMixedKernel for where it is stripped.
//
// WHAT GETS STAMPED. The attr asserts a placement — "this call runs on the AIV
// lane" — so it is written exactly where the region is what DECIDES that, and
// nowhere else. The walk visits every call in the region; a call is stamped
// when both hold:
//
//   * it does not STATE its own lane (core_affinity::HasStatedLane): a
//     `tile.create` shared by policy so both lanes can declare the buffer, or a
//     `system.syncall(core_type="mix")` that rendezvouses both cores, is placed
//     by its own declaration. Region membership does not outrank that, so
//     recording a contrary placement on it would be a false claim.
//   * its intrinsic affinity is SHARED, i.e. nothing about the op, its kwargs
//     or its operand memory spaces already fixes a lane. This is the case the
//     carrier exists for: SHARED is what ExpandMixedKernel duplicates onto both
//     lanes, and `pld.system.notify` — core-agnostic by ISA, hence SHARED — is
//     the op whose double-fire started all this.
//   * duplication would actually be WRONG for it (IsNoDuplicateCall).
//
// SHARED ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH, and getting this wrong is a miscompile rather
// than a missed optimisation. Pinning a call to AIV does not merely *place* it
// — it REMOVES it from the cube lane. For a duplicate-safe SHARED op that is a
// silent semantic change: `pld.system.wait` inside a region would stop blocking
// the cube core, so the matmul races ahead of the peer's data it was waiting
// for. The same reasoning covers any SHARED op that defines a value a cube
// statement outside the region consumes — pinning it would leave the AIC body
// referencing a variable it no longer defines. So the stamp is written only for
// the ops whose registration says duplication changes program meaning.
//
// The three intrinsic answers left out are left out because the region does not
// decide them, not to save space:
//
//   * VECTOR is already the AIV lane; the stamp would restate what the op's own
//     memory spec says.
//   * CUBE inside a region is an authoring error that check (a) reports; a
//     stamp cannot fix it and ClassifyCallAffinity declines to override it.
//   * MIXED IS the cross-core transfer — `tile.aiv_shard` / `tile.aic_gather`
//     and a C/V-crossing `tile.move` lower to a tpush on one lane plus a tpop
//     on the other, so they genuinely run on both and "aiv" would be false of
//     them. (The printed low-level boundary form also accepts no kwarg beyond
//     `split=`, so stamping one would break the print -> parse round-trip.)
//
// Consequently a region's ordinary vector compute is untouched, and a mixed
// comm kernel gains exactly one attr — on the notify.
//
// Being an IRMutator, this descends into for / if / while / seq bodies, so a
// comm op nested in a loop inside the region is stamped like any other. The
// re-stamp guard keeps it idempotent, which is what makes NESTED regions work:
// an inner region is lowered (and stamped) by the recursive LowerStmts call
// before the outer arm stamps its whole lowered body, and a duplicate key would
// violate the attrs unique-key invariant.
//
// Only ``Call`` is stamped, never ``Submit``: submits are task launches inside
// a pl.manual_scope, which is Orchestration-level, whereas SplitAivScopeStmt
// lives in InCore function bodies — the two cannot co-occur. (ExpandMixedKernel
// likewise classifies affinity from Calls only.)
